        <p>Next week we are taking a camping trip to Florence, Oregon. I am very excited to be able to get away for a little while. The campground is about six hours away, so it will be quite the trek with a child, a dog, and two cats in the back seat of our truck. We will also be hauling the travel trailer, which is not normally the most relaxing drive; luckily my husband will be in charge of that part. I plan to do bootcamp work on the way. A break from gymnastics is a rare thing, and I am extremely excited for the trip.</p>
