        <p>It is the <b>remembering</b> HTML that is the <strong>difficult</strong> part. That is, until you repeat it enough times that it gets commited to <sup>memory</sup>.</p>
        <div>Certain aspects of HTML will likely need to be looked up each time someone hopes to use them. Something like: &#127799;, &#127802;, and &#127800;, are not used very often. It would be impossible to remember all the various options.</div>
