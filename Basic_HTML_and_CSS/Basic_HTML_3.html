			<p2>Cats are such funny characters, and they all have such unique personalities. I have two cats, and both of my cats are obsessed with me. It is difficult to get <i>any</i> alone time, due to my two companions. There have been times while working on this boot camp, where I have two chairs at my workstation. However, neither chair is available for use because of the cats. Instead, I stand while they sleep next to me.</p2>

		<p>Hiro and Mystic get along much the same as any brother and sister would. They fight frequently, and demonstrate emotions of jealousy and anger. But the moment that Mystic lets out a cry for help, Hiro is right there by her side to protect her and bring her comfort. It is really sweet to see the protective big brother come to little sister's aid.</p>
