			<h3>How long until it is diagnosed as insomnia?</h3>
			<p>I can tell you: waking up at <time>12:30&nbsp; a.m.</time> is not so much fun. But then again, waking up at 3:30&nbsp; a.m. is not much more fun. It also is not that enjoyable to stay awake until roughly 7:30&nbsp; a.m. while lying down in bed with your eyes closed. And then, to finally drift back to sleep is so wonderful, <b>until</b> 7:45&nbsp; a.m. when your daughter comes in to your room to check to see if you are awake, <i>and makes sure you are</i>. &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; Awwwww, such restful nights!</p>
