		<p>Here is a quote from Kidadl.com:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://kidadl.com/articles/best-horse-riding-quotes-sayings-and-phrases"> Horses are among the most powerful, majestic and loving creatures that make nature even more beautiful while riding them. And so it makes even more sense that the horse and its riders or owners can express their connection with the horse with such passion and generosity.
